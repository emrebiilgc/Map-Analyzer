# Map-Analyzer
Find the shortest path to the destination
The Road Analysis and Optimization System is a project designed to analyze and compare two approaches to road design: prioritizing the shortest travel distances and minimizing construction resources. The system performs three main tasks:

Calculating the Fastest Route:
Using an algorithm that considers road distances, the system identifies the quickest path between a starting and an ending point on a given map, prioritizing efficiency for travelers.

Constructing a Barely Connected Map:
In a scenario where all roads are disrupted, the system designs a minimal road network that connects all points without cycles, thereby reducing resource usage while maintaining connectivity.

Performance Analysis:
The system evaluates the differences between the original map and the minimal network by comparing the total construction material usage and the fastest route lengths, providing insights into the trade-offs between resource efficiency and travel convenience.

The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code. It also includes robust input handling and adheres to specified algorithms to maintain consistency and accuracy in outputs.
